# Crypto Review Preparation

This document is the starting point for an external cryptography review.

## Algorithms And Crates

| Area | Algorithms | Crates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDF encryption read/write | RC4-40/128 legacy, AES-128-CBC, AES-256-CBC, PDF R2-R6 key derivation, MD5/SHA-256/384/512 | `aes`, `cbc`, `md-5`, `sha2`, internal RC4, `zeroize` |
| Signatures | CMS/PKCS#7 SignedData, RSA/SHA-256, ByteRange verification. ECDSA/EdDSA/RSA-PSS are reported as unsupported. | `cms`, `rsa`, `sha2`, `sha1`, `x509-cert`, `der`, `spki`, `const-oid` |
| Randomness | IVs, salts, file keys, PDF file IDs | `getrandom` OS CSPRNG |
| Constant-time comparisons | Server API keys; PDF password verifier hashes | `subtle` |

## Key Handling

- Passwords and private keys are caller-supplied and are not logged.
- Server API keys are read from environment variables and compared without
  early-exit timing leakage.
- PDF encryption uses random IVs/salts/file keys from `getrandom`.
- PDF encryption passwords in `EncryptParams`, derived file keys, per-object
  keys, reader `EncryptionContext` keys, writer `EncryptState` keys, R6
  intermediate buffers, and password-verifier scratch buffers use
  `zeroize::Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>` so heap buffers are wiped on drop.
- Serialized verifier fields (`/O`, `/U`, `/OE`, `/UE`, `/Perms`) remain normal
  `Vec<u8>` because they are written into the PDF encryption dictionary.
- RSA signing keys are parsed into RustCrypto `rsa::RsaPrivateKey`. That type
  does not implement `Zeroize` in the current dependency line, so Wellfriend cannot
  honestly claim private-key heap wiping until the dependency supports it or the
  signer storage is redesigned. Private-key operations are local API/CLI
  operations and are not exposed as a built-in network signing oracle.

## Self-Review Results

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| CSPRNG for IVs/salts/file keys | Confirmed: `random_bytes` delegates to `getrandom`. |
| IV reuse | No fixed IV for stream/string encryption; AES-128/256 CBC uses fresh random IVs. V5 key wrapping uses the spec-required zero IV for `/UE` and `/OE`. |
| Constant-time secret comparison | PDF user/owner password verifier hashes and server API keys use constant-time comparison. |
| Key zeroization | PDF encryption key material and password scratch buffers now use zeroizing wrapper types on returned/internal paths; serialized public verifier bytes remain ordinary vectors by design. RSA private-key heap wiping remains dependency-limited. |
| Padding oracle exposure | Decryption is local library processing, not a network oracle by itself. Server errors are sanitized and do not expose padding detail. |
| Signature integrity / trust / coverage are distinct (H-3) | The verifier reports cryptographic integrity, signer trust, and coverage as separate properties; the overall verdict is `Trusted` only when integrity verifies **and** the signer chains to a configured trust anchor (in validity, not revoked) **and** coverage is whole-file. With no anchors configured, trust is `NotVerified` and a cryptographically valid self-signed signature is `ValidUntrusted` — never reported as trusted. Tests cover valid/tampered/appended-after-signing, self-signed-not-trusted, pinned-anchor-trusted, unrelated-anchor-untrusted. |
| Trust-chain/LTV | Chain verification against caller-configured DER trust anchors is implemented and tested (direct-pin and issuer-signature-verified paths) with validity-period and embedded-revocation gating. Live TSA/OCSP/CRL fetching and system trust-store policy remain deployment-specific and should be reviewed externally. |
| RustSec advisory review | `rsa 0.9.10` is affected by `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` (Marvin timing side channel) and has no fixed RustCrypto upgrade in the current dependency line as of 2026-06-26. It is an explicit cargo-audit/cargo-deny exception, not an unreviewed pass. Do not expose RSA private-key operations as a remotely timed signing oracle; external crypto audit should prioritize replacement or mitigation. |

## RUSTSEC-2023-0071 Decision Record

`RUSTSEC-2023-0071` covers the Marvin timing side channel in RustCrypto `rsa`.
Wellfriend currently depends on `rsa 0.9.10` through the PDF signature stack for
RSA/SHA-256 signing and verification compatibility. No fixed RustCrypto `rsa`
release is available in the dependency line used here, and a migration to a
different signing backend would be a larger API/security design change.

Current exposure assessment:

- Wellfriend does not run an always-on remote signing service. RSA private-key use is
  a local library/CLI operation unless a deployment wraps it that way.
- The self-hosted HTTP server does not expose a signing endpoint.
- Signature verification consumes public material and is not the private-key
  timing oracle described by Marvin.
- Deployments must not expose attacker-controlled repeated RSA private-key
  operations over a low-noise network path without adding their own mitigation
  or replacing the backend.

Decision for this release line: keep `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` as a visible exception
in `deny.toml` and security-audit CI, with the above usage constraint and this
document as the justification. Revisit on every dependency/security review and
prefer migration when a fixed or better-maintained pure-Rust option is available.

## Known Crypto Limitations

- RC4 and AES-128 are supported for interoperability with existing PDFs, not
  recommended for new sensitive documents.
- Full live PAdES LTA/document timestamp refresh is not claimed.
- Public-key PDF encryption handlers are implemented for scoped explicit-provider PubSec KeyTrans decryption and full-rewrite writing/re-encryption. Standalone PDF-MAC creation/verification is implemented for AESV4 full rewrite and never returns `valid` from structure-only inspection. PKCS #12/PFX provider extraction is implemented with bounded non-WASM RSA identity matching. Certificate trust, revocation, signer identity validation, non-KeyTrans PubSec recipient classes, encrypted incremental PubSec updates, AttachedToSig PDF-MAC binding, ambiguous/non-RSA PFX bundles, and WASM PFX extraction remain unsupported.
- ECDSA, EdDSA, and RSA-PSS signing/verification are not implemented yet; the
  current signer applies RSA/SHA-256 for compatibility.
- RustCrypto `rsa` currently carries `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` with no fixed upgrade;
  this is documented as an explicit advisory exception until the dependency can
  be replaced or patched.
- RustCrypto `RsaPrivateKey` does not implement `Zeroize` in this dependency
  line, so private-key object memory wiping remains a residual dependency item.

## Audit Questions

- Are all PDF R2-R6 key derivation edge cases interoperable and constant-time
  enough for the threat model?
- Are CMS signed attributes, digest computation, and ByteRange handling correct
  for adversarial PDFs?
- Is trust-chain policy explicit enough for integrators?
- Should the RSA signing implementation be replaced, gated, or redesigned to
  eliminate the Marvin advisory and private-key zeroization limitation?
