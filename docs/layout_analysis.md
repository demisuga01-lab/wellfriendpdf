# Geometric Layout Analysis & Structured Extraction

`oxide extract-text --structured` recovers **document structure** (columns,
blocks, reading order) from a page's positioned text, rather than dumping text
top-to-bottom. This is a capability Poppler's CLIs largely lack: `pdftotext`
(even `-layout`) does spatial text placement but does **not** segment a page
into a logical structure or recover reading order across columns.

```
oxide extract-text in.pdf --structured                 # reading-order text
oxide extract-text in.pdf --structured --format json   # block tree + bboxes
oxide extract-text in.pdf -p 1-3 --structured          # a page range
oxide extract-text in.pdf --region 0,396,306,792       # top-left quarter
```

This is **additive**. The default `oxide extract-text` path is byte-for-byte
unchanged, so the parity-harness numbers (which compare against plain
`pdftotext`) are unaffected.

## The algorithm (XY-cut + Docstrum-style spacing)

Implemented in `crates/engine/src/analysis/layout.rs`, operating purely on the
positioned text chunks (`TextChunk { x, y, width, font_size, … }` in PDF user
space). All thresholds are **document-relative** — scaled to the median font
size and the estimated line pitch — so the analysis generalises across DPIs and
font sizes (no absolute-pixel constants).

1. **Box construction.** Each non-vertical, non-empty chunk becomes an
   axis-aligned box `[x, x+width] × [y, y+font_size]`.

2. **Spacing estimate (Docstrum-style).** The characteristic line height is the
   median font size; the typical inter-line *pitch* is a low percentile (25th)
   of the gaps between adjacent text rows — deliberately the *common small* gap,
   so normal line spacing is never mistaken for a block boundary.

3. **Recursive XY-cut.** Project the boxes onto the X and Y axes; find the
   widest empty band (valley) in either projection that exceeds its threshold:
   - a **vertical** cut (gap along X, wider than ~1.2 line heights) separates
     **columns**;
   - a **horizontal** cut (gap along Y, wider than a normal line gap) separates
     stacked **blocks**.
   Cut at the *larger* qualifying gap, then recurse on each side. The recursion
   yields a region tree whose leaves are blocks.

4. **Reading-order traversal.** Columns are emitted left-to-right (or
   right-to-left for an RTL-dominant page — see below); stacked blocks
   top-to-bottom. This is what produces correct multi-column reading order: the
   column gutter is cut *first*, so each column is read fully before the next.

5. **Block & line formation.** Within each leaf region, items are grouped into
   lines by baseline proximity and joined with inferred word spacing; lines are
   split into paragraph blocks at vertical gaps larger than the typical pitch.

### RTL support

When the page is RTL-dominant (most chunks are right-to-left, detected via the
chunk's `is_rtl` flag from the BiDi-aware collector), column reading order is
reversed (right column first) and each RTL line's token order is reversed for
display. (Carried over from the BiDi work; see `text/reading_order.rs`.)

## Output

`--format text` emits the page text in reading order, blocks separated by a
blank line. `--format json` emits the structured tree:

```json
{ "pages": [ { "page": 1, "blocks": [
  { "bbox": {"x0":…,"y0":…,"x1":…,"y1":…}, "font_size": 10.0,
    "lines": [ { "text": "…", "bbox": {…}, "is_rtl": false }, … ] }
] } ] }
```

The bounding boxes are in PDF user space (y-up). This structure feeds the table
extractor and is useful for downstream consumers (chunking for RAG, layout-aware
diffing, HTML reflow).

## Region extraction

`--region x0,y0,x1,y1` is available on `extract-text`, `extract-tables`, and
`extract-images`. Coordinates are PDF user-space points with origin at the
page's bottom-left, matching the layout JSON boxes. A text line, word, table, or
image placement is included when its center is inside the region or at least
half of its box overlaps the region. Regions partly outside the page are clamped
to the page box; regions with no page overlap return a clean input error.

## The win — reading-order correctness (measured)

Because the standard harness compares against plain `pdftotext` (which
interleaves columns), the structured improvement does **not** show in that
similarity metric — it is measured **directly** against hand-authored
ground-truth reading order on synthetic multi-column fixtures
(`crates/engine/tests/layout_analysis.rs`).

On a **three-column** page drawn in interleaved row-major order (the worst case
for a naive reader):

| Extraction | Reading-order correctness |
|---|---:|
| Default (`extract-text`) | **88%** (interleaves the 3rd column) |
| Structured (`--structured`) | **100%** (reads each column fully, in order) |

The default path's column heuristic only handles two columns, so a third column
interleaves exactly as plain `pdftotext` does; the XY-cut analyzer reads C1, then
C2, then C3 — the correct order. Single-column pages are unchanged.

## Honest limitations

- **Not a substitute for tagged-PDF structure.** This is geometric inference.
  Use `oxide extract-text --semantic` to prefer `/StructTreeRoot` when present
  and fall back to this analyzer when absent.
- **Tables inside text** are segmented as blocks, not parsed as tables, by the
  layout pass — table *parsing* is the separate `extract-tables` tool
  (`docs/tables.md`).
- **Pathological layouts** (overlapping columns, rotated text blocks, dense
  figures with captions) can still mis-segment; figure/caption detection is not
  implemented.
- **Vertical (CJK) text** is excluded from the XY-cut (the existing
  vertical reading-order path handles it); a mixed vertical+horizontal page
  analyses only its horizontal text here.
