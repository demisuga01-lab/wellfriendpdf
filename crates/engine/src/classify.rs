//! Per-**page** classifier: is this page digital-born (real extractable text),
//! scanned (a full-page image needing OCR), or a searchable scan (a full-page
//! image with an existing/invisible text layer the producer already OCR'd)?
//!
//! This is the routing gate in front of the extraction pipeline. A real-world
//! PDF is often *mixed* — a born-digital report with a few scanned inserts, or a
//! scanned doc with a digital cover — so the decision is made **per page**, not
//! per document. Digital-born pages (including searchable scans) go through the
//! consolidated digital-born extraction pass; pages classified [`PageSource::Scanned`]
//! are routed to the OCR path (a documented seam the OCR stage fills in).
//!
//! # Signals (combined; never decided on one alone)
//!
//! - **Text coverage** — non-whitespace character count and the fraction of page
//!   area covered by text boxes. Near-zero → likely scanned.
//! - **Image coverage** — the fraction of page area covered by image XObject
//!   placements. One image covering most of the page → likely a scan.
//! - **Invisible text** — render-mode-3 text (`Tr 3`), the hallmark of a
//!   scanner-produced searchable layer over the scan image. Invisible text is
//!   still *usable* text, so a page with a full-page image **and** a real or
//!   invisible text layer is [`PageSource::DigitalBornOverImage`], NOT scanned —
//!   it must use its existing layer, never be re-OCR'd.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Pure geometry + counts; no `HashMap` iterated to produce output. Same page →
//! same classification.
