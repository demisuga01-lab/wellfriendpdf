//! PDF writer / serializer.
//!
//! The reader/parser side of the engine turns PDF bytes into an in-memory
//! object model ([`PdfObject`] / [`PdfDictionary`] / streams). This module does
//! the reverse: it takes a set of indirect objects and emits a syntactically
//! valid, openable PDF file (header, body, classic cross-reference table,
//! trailer, `startxref`, `%%EOF`).
//!
//! # Stream data
//!
//! Streams are copied **verbatim**: the original, still-filter-encoded `raw`
//! bytes are written unchanged together with their existing `/Filter` and
//! `/DecodeParms` entries, and `/Length` is reset to the exact number of bytes
//! emitted. The engine never re-encodes stream data when writing — that keeps
//! output faithful and small and avoids a decode/re-encode round-trip that
//! could lose information. (Re-compression of uncompressed streams is a
//! possible future optimization; correctness does not need it.)
//!
//! Note that the reader *decrypts* strings and stream bytes as objects are
//! fetched, so the bytes handed to the writer are already plaintext. Output is
//! therefore **always unencrypted** — manipulating an encrypted input decrypts
//! it. Re-encryption of output is a future enhancement.
//!
//! # Object numbering and references
//!
//! When objects are copied out of one or more source documents their object
//! numbers will collide, so the writer assigns a fresh, contiguous numbering
//! for the output (object 1, 2, 3, …) and rewrites every
//! [`PdfObject::Reference`] using a remap built during the copy. See
//! [`build_subset`] / [`build_merged`] and [`rewrite_references`].
