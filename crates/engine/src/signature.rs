//! Digital signature creation and verification (`pdfsig`-equivalent).
//!
//! Signing appends a signature field and detached CMS `SignedData` in an
//! incremental-update revision, preserving the original file bytes as an exact
//! prefix. Verification of each signature field:
//!   1. reads the `/ByteRange` and hashes those exact original file bytes,
//!   2. parses `/Contents` as a PKCS#7 / CMS `SignedData` (RFC 5652),
//!   3. verifies the signer's RSA signature over the signed attributes (or the
//!      content digest directly), checking the `messageDigest` signed-attribute
//!      against the byte-range digest, and
//!   4. reports the signer certificate's details and whether the signature
//!      covers the whole file or the document was modified after signing.
//!
//! # Honest scope
//!
//! "Valid" here means **cryptographically valid**: the signature math checks
//! out against the signer certificate's public key and the signed digest
//! matches the `/ByteRange` bytes. LTV support embeds RFC 3161 timestamp
//! tokens supplied by the caller, writes PAdES-style DSS validation material
//! (`/Certs`, `/OCSPs`, `/CRLs`, `/VRI`) as an incremental update, and reports
//! the PAdES baseline level implied by embedded material. Trust-chain
//! validation to a configured root, live TSA/OCSP/CRL fetching, OCSP response
//! policy validation, and timestamp imprint/TSA trust are intentionally outside
//! this core primitive. RSA (PKCS#1 v1.5) signatures are supported;
//! ECDSA/EdDSA and RSA-PSS are not yet (reported as `unsupported_algorithm`).
