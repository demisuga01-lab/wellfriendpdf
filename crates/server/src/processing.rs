//! Per-request resource safety: cooperative processing timeout and limit checks.
//!
//! ## Why cooperative cancellation, not a tower timeout
//!
//! The heavy work (render / extract) runs CPU-bound inside
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` + rayon. A `tower::TimeoutLayer` only times
//! out the *async future* — it returns an error to the client but the blocking
//! thread keeps running, still pegging a CPU core. That leaks workers under
//! attack, which is exactly the DoS we're defending against.
//!
//! Instead we hand the engine a [`CancelToken`] and arm a timer task that trips
//! it at the deadline. The engine polls the flag in its hot loops (operator
//! dispatch, tiling tiles, per-page parallel render) and bails out, freeing the
//! thread. This actually STOPS the work rather than abandoning the wait.
